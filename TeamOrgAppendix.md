# Meeting Coordination

1. The team will have the same times each week to allow each person to not forget, and remind each other in class (as most meetings will take place after class) and over Discord.
2. If there is any conflict for meetings where not everyone can attend, the team will rely on the weekends or later in the evenings for meetings. This can vary on schedules and will be discussed accordingly.
3. Preferred format for meetings will vary. The dedicated 4 hours shown above will be in person, but most additional ones will be virtually on Discord voice channels unless an assignment or project requires hands-on work.
4. The only procedures needed is just to ensure that the team is able to meet each week to go over upcoming assignments or work on the project or team assignments.

# Team Coordination

1. There will be an ahead of time "deadline" for the team to finish the assignment if it is one that is worked on at various times by each member. Then, to ensure that it is submitted, whoever is the one to do so will send a confirmation screenshot in the group chat to let everyone know that it was indeed submitted.
2. When assigning tasks, the team usually volunteers for what they feel comfortable in doing, otherwise the task is worked between at least two people to ensure it is done correctly and everyone learns how to do this task. If no one knows how to complete something, or does not have any knowledge of it, the team will all go into office hours to learn more about it.
3. The team plans to meet when feedback is given out to go over it and add the corrections right after it is given. We all have learned from last semester to not wait to apply the corrections last minute, as it helps other assignments be completed with more ease.
