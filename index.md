Increase production rate each year and lower the cost by 5%
Research smaller electronics to allow room for improvements every few years
Compare sales to competitors to lower or higher costs to improve sales

**Team Goals**

* Expand upon knowledge of  electronic components and how to utilize them in final product demonstration
* Make connections with fellow team members, classmates, and faculty. 
* Add projects designed or built in EGR314 to career portfolios 
* Learn various ways to get to the same point with the expanse of electronic selections
* Combining different skill sets to help each team member work on something new and learn how each system works as a whole
* Gain new programming skills with a new IDE and different language techniques


Team 203â€™s goals include working on a project together that will not only create a finalized working product, but will teach each team member something new and incorporate many design ideas into a final design.

### Product Mission Satement
Team 203 plans to be able to create an efficient and affordable weather station type device that will allow ease of use for the consumer and allow room for improving day to day life. This product will allow the team to be able to work together to create a finalized product that displays accurate data and demonstrates the skills learned throughout the course.

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements
* For example, how did your team organize, combine, and split needs into the list you arrived at? 
* Justify the process by which your team assigned weights for importance, using both interview notes and internal team discussions.
* Discuss the process by which your team converted user needs into specifications.
* Discuss, with detail, how your design will be assessed according to the "aspects", to ensure your product meets your requirements.


## Design Ideation
* What role each team member played in generating ideas.
* What types of brainstorming worked? What didn't?
* What was your process for organizing and ranking ideas? Who created or sketched each concept?
