## Team Organization

### Charter

Produce a working product that meets design requirements and gives team members useful experiences to use throughout their careers. Working together to design, prototype, and manufacture to meet the following goals:

**Industry goals**
* Sell roughly 100,000 units a year
* Every 6 months look to improving the product with little cost or production set backs
* Increase production rate each year and lower the cost by 5%
* Research smaller electronics to allow room for improvements every few years
* Compare sales to competitors to lower or higher costs to improve sales

**Team Goals**
* Expand upon knowledge of  electronic components and how to utilize them in final product demonstration
* Make connections with fellow team members, classmates, and faculty. 
* Add projects designed or built in EGR314 to career portfolios 
* Learn various ways to get to the same point with the expanse of electronic selections
* Combining different skill sets to help each team member work on something new and learn how each system works as a whole
* Gain new programming skills with a new IDE and different language techniques

Team 203â€™s goals include working on a project together that will not only create a finalized working product, but will teach each team member something new and incorporate many design ideas into a final design.

### Product Mission Satement
Team 203 plans to be able to create an efficient and affordable weather station type device that will allow ease of use for the consumer and allow room for improving day to day life. This product will allow the team to be able to work together to create a finalized product that displays accurate data and demonstrates the skills learned throughout the course.

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements
### Organization
Based on related project searches a list of user needs was generated. The list of user needs was then subdivided into 6 categories: Physical properties, Data, Wireless features, Power, Accesibility, and Other. These categories were chosen because they seemed to encapsulate the positive and negative reviews that similar products were receiving.
### Justification
Of the 6 categories we determined the 3 most important to be: Power, Data, and Physical properties. Our team assigned weights for importance based on the frequency in which a problem occured in related products. 
### Specifications
We converted the needs into product specifications by analyzing the common pitfils of related products and assigning a general solution. An example of this would be that customers dislike cumbersome products, therefore, a product specification would be that it needs to be portable. (i.e less than 50 lbs).
### Requirements
* Maximized Battery Life
* Must weigh less than 50 lbs (22.6 kg)
* Easy to use and setup
* Stores data for future use
* Simple user interface
* Portable
* Accurate sensor readings

## Design Ideation
### Roles
Each team member in Team 203 was given the task of generating 25 or more ideas that encompassed at least one of the design requirements. The 100 ideas were posted to a online collaborative jamboard allowing the team to take inspiration from each other to effectivly brainstom ideas. Team members then organized the ideas into catgories and ranked them. The top three design concepts were democratically chosen and created into vector drawings for the next stages in prototyping.
### Brainstorming
The most effective strategy for our team used for brainstorming during this process was riffing on each others ideas. Our team found that having a general concept to ideate and improve made our collective brainstorming much simpler. The worst strategy for brainstorming our team found tended to be the "solo" method. We found that thinking of original ideas without inspiration or help from the team can be difficult and time consuming.
### Organization
The process for organizing ideas started by subdividing into three categories: Weather realted, Self-regulating, and Sensor based. The preceding rows in each category are ranked in descending order of favoritism, with the top rows containing the ideas we were most excited about. Each of the three product concept sketch ideas were democratically selected from the top row of each categories. Once the the three best concepts were chosen they were drawn into vector images

## Selected Design
### Design Overview

The team chose Design Concept 3 - The Plant Health Music Alarm for our chosen design. Our team decided to change some major components of the design, to better fit project requirments, as well as taking into acount user satisfaction and needs. The team decided to move away from the idea of an alarm, and move towards using an OLED to diplay information gathered by the sensors.

The current design that the team has gone with has been updated to allow more room for electronics and a new exterior design improvement. The design will provide a safe area for the electronics that is out of the way of the irrigation and has an easy accessible point. The exterior was altered with holes to allow more air flow in the box. Although the team wants to be able to control the environment as much as possible, without a fan or air flow in the box, there would be more challenges with keeping the plats alive.
