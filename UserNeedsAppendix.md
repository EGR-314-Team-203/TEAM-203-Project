The battery life has been terrific as well." | [Explicit] Device can be accessed remotely via a mobile device. | [Explicit] The battery has a long lifespan.

| "This has been so much fun. I have my own weather station that was easy to set up, is accurate and provides lots of information. It has an understated profile and is well made. I was able to attach it to my roof. The app for my android works extremely well. The widget is incredible.This has taken the place of my main weather app. I look at it frequently throughout the day.I found it on sale, however, after using it for 2 months, I would have paid full price if I knew how great it would perform." | [Explicit] The device is accurate and gives correct information. | [Explicit] Included software is easy to us | "Main goal measure rain and contribute data. Hurricane Ian dispersed over us and we had 0.06 inches of rain according to the meter. Our old fashion rain gauge says 2.25 inches. We are farmers. I have setup four (4) other stations in the northeast and they also have same issue! How could this have a four/five star rating by Amazon customers? The stations are on a 4x4 post in the middle of a field, no obstruction for 60 feet. Not an install issue. Have filled out calibration form with tempest and do know my station IDs. Still this is not a reasonable expectation for owners-was not simple entry from the app. Had to go to website and fill out a form." |
| [Explicit] Device has clear instructions on how to install. | User friendly setup and installation. (Explicit) | "It took longer to climb up the ladder and install the unit than it did to set it up, very simple, very easy to do and it went right to work, well thought out, well built, easy setup and install" | [Latent] The device is user-friendly. |
| [Explicit] Easy setup | [Explicit] Simple user interface | "As a scientist i love data, i have had an accurite for over 10 years. This was a replacement for old reliable… It is not ready for prime time: It will not charge despite 4-6 hours of direct sunBattery was dead in 2 weeks. Ordered external power supply which kept battery charged but it would lose connection with base station after an hour when on external battery despite being 20 feet from hub and router. I just can not get more than 10 min of data when on battery power, disconnect power and it works but battery dies… Just ordered a new accurite… sigh…" | [Latent] The device has a longer lifetime. | 
| The device has a reliable battery. (Explicit) | [Latent] Device is able to last for an extended duration and/or be maintained for long periods of time. | "It's everything Tempest advertises. Truly 5 mins to set up. App is superb. Connection to Alexa is easy (most important feature for me). Durable. The solar power feature is excellent. Low profile with no extraneous parts, like vanes. I replaced my SainLogic with this one. I'm buying another for my vacation home. This is the real deal!" | [Explicit] Device has clear instructions on how to install. |
| [Explicit] The device has multiple functions and is very accessible. | "Lasted about a year then quit powering up. Solar power is a joke. The wind is a joke and the rain is a joke. Don't waste your money. Get a Acurite or Ambient Station." | [Latent] The device has a longer lifetime. | N?A |

| "The temperature and barometric pressure stay right in sync with the NWS stations near me. Very accurate. Great display and features." | [Latent] The device is user-friendly.
[Explicit] The device is accurate and gives correct information. | "In short, not all of the weather stations functions worked (rain gauge and ability to connect to the internet for cell phone notification) and the functions that did work (temp) were inaccurate by approximately 5 degrees. The product looks good and was easy enough to set up (except for its ability to connect to the internet which never worked), but after getting it set up and accepting it not being able to connect to the internet (not important for me) I recognized the temp was horribly inaccurate. I double checked the temp with multiple thermometers which confirmed the Logia was not working properly. Not a good product. Returned. Looking for a new weather station." | [Explicit] The device's parts should take accurate weather readings.
[Explicit] Device should be able to connect to internet. |
| "This was a perfect weather station. Set up was a breeze (pun intended!). Has so many functions. Remember that you need a mounting pole. It clearly says it is not included, but I missed that important part." | [Explicit] Device has clear instructions on how to install.
[Latent] Final product comes with all necessary components. | "Bought this the end of August. It is now the end of November and the bearings in the anemometer are already shot. I realize Wyoming has serious wind but come on, the bearings should last longer than three months. The thing barely rotates at 1.5 mph when the wind is gusting at 35 mph. Great when it was working but a waste of money in the end." | [Latent] The device has a longer lifetime.
[Explicit] The device's parts are durable and can hold up in weather conditions. |
| "Very impressed with the operation and apparent accuracy. The display can easily be seen across the room. Connection to wifi and Wunderground Weather was not too difficult and is a great asset for accumulating past data." | [Latent] The device has a guided installation process that the user can follow.
[Explicit] The device has multiple functions and is very accessible. | "This device uses too many different batteries and the moving parts stick so you don't get accurate readings.Will not purchase this again not recommended to anyone" | [Explicit] Device can rely on one (or just a few) power sources. |
