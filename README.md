### Introduction	
- This semester, the EGR 314 (Embedded Systems Design) class is focusing on weather-related measurements. All teams are tasked with creating a deliverable product that, in some sense, measures and responds to the environment around it. Our team, Team 203, is creating a plant environment box that measure the temperature and humidity within a contained planter that can adjust watering and the lid movement in order to help the plant thrive in the best conditions.

### Team Organization
- The team has goals that will; be accomplished with this project and is stated through the charter and mission statement.

### User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements	
- Compiling a list of needs and requirements, the team is able to narrow down project aspects that will help drive the goals hoping to be accomplished as well as working towards the end goal of creating a controlled enviroment.

### Design Ideation 
- This section works through the different stages of project ideas the team has gone through and shows the process to get to the most updated design.

### Selected Design 
- The selected design is generated from the user needs, requirements and various design ideations to create the most updated design. This section shows several views of the most updated design the team is working towards, that is compiled of previous ideas that worked the best for the team's goals.

### Block Diagram
- The team is able to compile the required subsystems for this project with the Block Diagram. This is an overview of what is involved in the project as a whole.

### Component Selection	
- In order to meet the project requirments, the team came up with a list of components for each member's subsystem, and worked through the datasheet and power budget to be able to decide the best component for the susbystsems and project.
- Included is the final selected components as well as the power budget the team worked on, that shows how the team plans to pwoer the product.

### Hardware Proposal	
- Included in this section is the most recent version of the team's schematic. Combining all subystems onto one page and any other team based ideas, this will be the starting point to the teams printed circuit board
- As well, the team's completed Bill of Materials and total cost is added. 
- 
### Software Proposal	
- The most recently updated software diagram is included in this section and creates an overview as to how the code will function with all of the subsystems.
