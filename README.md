# Team 203 Checkpoint 1 Report
_Arizona State University_


## Design Ideation
### Roles
Each team member was given the task of generating 25 ideas that encompassed at least one of the design requirements. The ideas were posted to a jamboard allowing the team to take inspiration from each other. Members then organized the ideas into catgories and ranked them. The top 3 design concepts were democratically chosen and created into vector drawings.
### Brainstorming
The most effective strategy for brainstorming during this process was riffing on each others ideas. Having a general concept to ideate and improve made brainstorming much simpler. The worst strategy for brainstorming tended to be the "solo" method. Thinking of original ideas without inspiration or help from the team can be difficult and time consuming.
### Organization
The process for organizing ideas started by subdividing into three categories: Weather realted, Self-regulating, and Sensor based. The preceding rows in each category are ranked in descending order of favoritism, with the top rows containing the ideas we were most excited about. Each of the three product concept sketch ideas were democratically selected from the top row of each categories. Once the the three best concepts were chosen they were drawn into vector images
