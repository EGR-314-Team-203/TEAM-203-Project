One of the first ideas was a drone that could check for temperature, moistures, etc. while in the air.

Another idea was an environment that could support plant life, especially in a confined space. The user could be notified of changes to the environment to help the plant more reffectively grow.

Our group's other idea was a windmill that could relay useful weather information and look out for major changes in weather that may affect reusable wind energy.
